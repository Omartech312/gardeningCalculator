# Gardening Calculator

This project takes static values from the game and user input to calculate the investment, revenue, and profit from different plants in TROVE.

## Prerequisites

- Python

## Using the program

The program starts by asking for the name of a gardening seed, and the user should write a substring of the seed name. For example, if the desired seed is eyestalks of Q'bthulhu seed, writing eye will suffice. Then, the program will prompt the price of the materials required to craft the seed, and the user has to check the unit price and input the price to the program. Finally, the program will prompt the user for the unit price this desired seed will produce to calculate the revenue and profits.
